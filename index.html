    <h2>Mission Statement:</h2>
    <div class="statement">
      <p>
        80% of households in america are single parent households. On average it
        costs to 18,865 U.S dollars to have a child in america. We believe all
        children deserve a chance at success. Children are all born innocent,
        It's our duty to make sure each and every child thrives. Our purpose is
        to provide support, encouragement and guidance to single parents in the
        pursuit of identifying life choice options that enhance their
        opportunities for career advancement and independence.
